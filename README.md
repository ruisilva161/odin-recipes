# odin-recipes
The current project is a simple recipe book using my HTML knowledge.
It will consist of a main page (index page), linking to several recipe pages.

Some skills I will demonstrate:
    - Basic command line 
    - Basic Git - commit my project to GitHub
    - Basic HTML (head, body, paragraphs, etc)
    - Using anchors and links
    - insert images
    - lists, etc.
