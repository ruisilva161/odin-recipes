        <h4><p>Simple fish pie to enjoy any time of the year. Make it up to 36 hours ahead before cooking and keep in the fridge.</p></h4>

         <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ red pepper, seeds removed, finely chopped</li>
            <li>225g peeled potatoes, cut into 1cm slices</li>
            <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
         </ul>   

         <h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small heavy-based frying pan that's about 20cm/8in in diameter. Add the onion and fry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pepper and potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and gently cook over a low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and the potatoes are cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and wipe the pan clean.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the bowl with the cooked mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan. Carefully pour in the egg mixture and sprinkle with parsley. Cook on a medium heat until the sides and top have just set and the base is lightly golden-brown. When the middle is set, carefully slide onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Put the pan on top of the omelette and flip over to cook the other side for 3–4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and just cooked through. Slide onto a plate to serve.</li>
         </ol>
